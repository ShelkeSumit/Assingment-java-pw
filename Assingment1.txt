Qs1 Ans: byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, String, boolean...

Qs2 Ans: Identifiers in Java are symbolic names used for identification. They can be a class name, variable name,
         method name, package name, constant name, and more. Hovever, In Java , There are some reserved words
         that can not be used as an identifier.

Qs3 Ans: A class declared with a final keyword is called final class. It does not allow itself to be inherited by another
         class.

Qs4 Ans: The first way to make a final class is to declare a class with final keyword. Another way is to declare all of
         its constructors as private. If a class has only private constructors, it cannot be subclassed.

Qs5 Ans: we can create an instance of final class in another class but cannot be inherited.

Qs6 Ans: Volatile is a declaration that a variable can be accessed by multiple threads and hence shouldn't be
         cached.

Qs7 Ans: It in Java is used to indicate that a field should not be serialized.

Qs8 Ans: There are two types of casting
         1. Primitive Casting: When the data is casted from one primitive type ( like int, float, double etcâ€¦ ) to another
            primitive type, then it is called primitive casting.

         2. Derrived casting: When the data is casted from one derived type to another derived type, then it is called
            derived casting.

Qs9 Ans: Wrapping of primitive content into corresponding wrapper class object is called boxing. Unwrapping the
         wrapper class object into corresponding primitive content is called unboxing.

Qs10 Ans:Keywords are the reserved words that have a pre defined meaning for the compiler and hence are
         restricted to be used as identifiers.
         Identifiers are the name assigned to different programming constructs like classes, interfaces, methods ,variables etc.
         Literals are the values that are assigned to Identifiers.
